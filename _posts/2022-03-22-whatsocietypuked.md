In the 1990s and 2000s we sold<br />
bombs and munitions from one nation to the next.<br />
Yet now culture rages on at light speed.

The tide changing / the corpses bleeding<br />
used arms by rust of neo-liberalism<br />
sold to other other nations.<br />
Now everyone is bleeding.

It's easy to point / at the old man smoking<br />
a joint, to sooth chronic pain.<br />
Yet the levers of power is far more profane.<br />
One doesn't need to be Black Bloc or Proud Boys.

One simply needs a television,<br />
Toon into CNN and MSNBC, Breit bart?<br />
Neo-Liberalism farts, and out comes Trump.<br />
Now take your lumps, swallow your wine.

Different bankers, Koch or Soros,<br />
finds everyone's pain rather divine.

The tide changing / the corpses bleeding<br />
used arms by rust of neo-liberalism<br />
sold to other other nations.<br />
Now everyone is bleeding.

Death comes soon, like smaller nukes,<br />
And what remains, who knows.<br />
We are what society puked.
