## SLOWLY SING LULLABIES
Bloody hands on floor.<br />
Licking tongue along the gore.<br />
Only those with lust<br />
On the floor, on the floor<br />
Devise ways for more blood.<br />

Hands behind the back<br />
Always one step behind.<br />
Neck and neck with death.<br />
Devise ways for more blood,<br />
Sliding hands on the floor. <br />

Along the floor I lay,<br />
Nocturnal moonlight abyss.<br />
Devise ways for more blood.<br />

Neck and neck with so many ways to go.<br />
Even as the moonlight fades,<br />
Coldly the daylight is no more.<br />
Karry with her cat in a napsack<br />
Slowly sings lullibies once more.
