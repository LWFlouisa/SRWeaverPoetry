Sometimes I
need small letters, or big
Leaves and twigs.

Sometimes I
need chaotic text and
other times not.

With both text I
write under the caption,
other times not.

Sometimes I
need red letters or black,
with brush or pen.

I like to splatter
the ink on large brushes,
I make a mess.

Sometimes I
need small letters, or big
Leaves and twigs.

And those leaves
become small branches
that always grow tall.
Leaves and twigs grow
from the mountains.

All the way to the river
flowing down the ridges.
