Sometimes I<br />
need small letters, or big<br />
Leaves and twigs.

Sometimes I<br />
need chaotic text and<br />
other times not.

With both text I<br />
write under the caption,<br />
other times not.

Sometimes I<br />
need red letters or black,<br />
with brush or pen.

I like to splatter<br />
the ink on large brushes,<br />
I make a mess.

Sometimes I<br />
need small letters, or big<br />
Leaves and twigs.

And those leaves<br />
become small branches<br />
that always grow tall.<br />
Leaves and twigs grow<br />
from the mountains.

All the way to the river<br />
flowing down the ridges.
