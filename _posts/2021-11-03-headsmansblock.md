<i>Beheaded Vampiress, Or a stray limmerick, 迷っている リメリック</i>

The chopping block was red with blood.<br />
The blood pouring all over,<br />
She snapped with a twist<br />
"I cant go away now little shits!<br />
It only hurts, like me doing the splits." 

That is to say,<br />
she needs no air to<br />
breath, being vamp.<br />
As she falls from the tall ramp,<br />
She complains of a cramp. 

The chopping block was red with blood.<br />
The blood pouring all over,<br />
She snapped with a twist<br />
"I cant go away now little shits!<br />
It only hurts, like me doing the splits." 

She survived her<br />
beheading thinking that<br />
mankind is the shit.
