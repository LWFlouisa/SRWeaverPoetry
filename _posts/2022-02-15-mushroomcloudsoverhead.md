Mushroom clouds are overhead,
global culture war.
Global culture war,
the clouds collect above horizon,
mankind fades. 

The clouds are like a spectre,
mushroom clouds so overhead. 

Os Eharinozarupaticos
Niyesa pahe, pahe os Azusacos.
Os Eharinozarupaticos
Vez niya os bowos niyo pahe. 

The clouds are like a spectre,
mushroom clouds so overhead.

Overhead over me.
