In the forest / dimly lit and black<br />
the trees sway back / and forth in the wind.<br />
The moon shines / glowing divine.<br />

The graveyard damp / and the midnight dark<br />
chills this young champ / without a spark<br />
resting / sleeping.<br />
Until the midnight / in lunar gaze<br />
fades into day / in this corn maze<br />
ghosts play with the flute.<br />
The land bleeding / from severed heads<br />
rains down with red / into the midnight<br />
into the rust / along stones.<br />

In the forest / dimly lit and black<br />
the trees sway back / and forth in the wind.<br />
The moon shines / glowing divine.<br />

Perhaps someday, the midnight hours,<br />
as the day approaches.<br />

Will no longer bleed.
