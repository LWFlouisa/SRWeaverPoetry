In the sky, clouds<br />
rise above. Shrouds<br />
smoking.<br />
The air green<br />
ruptures spleen,<br />
toxins.<br />
To think that life,<br />
with all its worry<br />
bites.<br />

In the past, if one<br />
can long for it today,<br />
Was once cleaner<br />
with green all over.<br />
Yet now that time has<br />
faded from memory.<br />

Once can clap and hope<br />
for roses in the garden.<br />

Yet this hope is<br />
for naught, we are rot<br />
rotting on this Earth.<br />

Id would like<br />
to give a less bleak<br />
picture, but no.<br />

That would be dishonest.<br />
That would be dishonest.<br />

For we our the rot on<br />
this dying toxic Earth.<br />

In the sky, clouds<br />
rise above. Shrouds<br />
smoking.<br />
The air green<br />
ruptures spleen,<br />
toxins.<br />
To think that life,<br />
with all its worry<br />
bites.<br />

No prayers can save us now,<br />
on this rotting Earth.<br />
