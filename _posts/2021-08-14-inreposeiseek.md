In repose I
sit wondering why
sleep
Gives way, in the
dark, flowing free.
Darkness
Beside the bed,
dreams dreaming
in bed. 

In repose I
sleep in this coffin
under the Earth.
I rest for all eternity,
I rest for all this time. 

Along the midnight forest
I seek blood
from a woman's neck.
Yet the desire fades.
I rest for all this time. 

I rest for all this time,
In repose I seek.
