The cherry blossom
pink as a bossom
blooms.
It blooms so bright,
winter falls soon.
Tonight
the shadows along
the hamlet gate
creaks. 

Along a winter
snowy wasteland so cold
the land is empty. 

Except the shadows calling,
calling for my presence. 

At first I thought
that I was saw things
lurking.
To think that the mind
conjures fancy
terrors.
At night the dead
Wander graveyard
Shambling. 

Along a winter
snowy wasteland so cold
the land is empty. 

Except the shadows calling,
calling for my presence. 

Only the sun is
My relief my
torment.
