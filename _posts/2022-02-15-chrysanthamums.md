Chains on fence give suspence.
The guillotines are bloody as the dead do pile.
Come and stay with me today. 

Chains on fence give suspence,
in courtyard by the fence the dead rot long
all in a pile. All in a pile 

Come and stay with me today,
all the roses and petunias dont compare,
to Chrysthamums common and scarce.
