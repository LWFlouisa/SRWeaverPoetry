How long till river dries in Summer?<br />
So long cooling vente as cold as Winter.<br />
The crow and rabbots sing final whispers.

In walking I wish the pain to go away,<br />
And yet all pain aching is painful memory.<br />
The crow and rabbots sing final whispers.

A moments whisper is broken by wind,<br />
And the distant trots of canines in soaken<br />
dirt, crow and rabbits sing final whispers.

The final whisper comes to a stop,<br />
And now the river is running so red.
