Christmas<br />
how it gives so<br />
many feelings<br />
of joy<br />
for normal women.<br />
And also for men.<br />
And yet<br />
by night when lights go,<br />
there is nothing to 

show for Christmas Day.<br />
All it gives is pain<br />
and dysphoria. 

With nothing for the pain.<br />
Only pain and apathy.
