I
These days artists<br />
sue each other for<br />
contract disputes. 

In middle ages,<br />
they executed each<br />
other on the rack. 

Now sit back and relax,<br />
Were all smothered in candlewax. 

II
In middle ages<br />
there were copper pens.<br />
All barrel shaped. 

One wrong move,<br />
and it's all over, thats<br />
all for bank contracts. 

There was untreated cateracts,<br />
and heads full of lice. 

III
But at least its<br />
not an execution<br />
and torture for 

fraudulent banks,<br />
scheming money landering,<br />
and making wine. 

Now sit back and relax,<br />
Were all smothered in candlewax.
