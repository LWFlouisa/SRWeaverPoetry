I
These days artists
sue each other for
contract disputes. 

In middle ages,
they executed each
other on the rack. 

Now sit back and relax, Were all smothered in candlewax. 

II
In middle ages
there were copper pens.
All barrel shaped. 

One wrong move,
and it's all over, thats
all for bank contracts. 

There was untreated cateracts,
and heads full of lice. 

III
But at least its
not an execution
and torture for 

fraudulent banks,
scheming money landering,
and making wine. 

Now sit back and relax, Were all smothered in candlewax.
