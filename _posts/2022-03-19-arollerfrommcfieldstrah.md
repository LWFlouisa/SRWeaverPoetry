You shall sing it after you sneer.
The moss shall see you there.
Odd me shall send you Shness.

I will run yeh an arrow shape.
Are you some roller from McFieldstrah.

Yea yea in a field yea.
In most fields that Sarah feels,
a ziggy is in the moss.
All is Nollerteh!

The Sethanie is a snake.
Are you milking Aeris, yea!

You will shall sing it at Zernerisimah.
And you see me there a lot.
Odd me Senyarothenya are an arrow at Nanya.
Man are you going to get some.

A world of McFieldstrah.
And all of you shall send.
In most fields that Sarah
will send you on,
Hosta La Vista Nollertah.

I will run yeh an arrow shape.
Are you some roller from McFieldstrah.
