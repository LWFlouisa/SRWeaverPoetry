Anarchism held me<br />
Nightly in its arms.<br />
After<br />
Rivers flow South<br />
Cabins warm soon.<br />
Haven<br />
Inside, the cult<br />
Slowly returns to<br />
Me, and

Yet that feels most<br />
natural, rather

What than I now know<br />
of stateless societies.

To think that Billy<br />
Meier would be<br />
tempting<br />
rather than freedom.<br />
And yet what freedom<br />
is it, that allows trans rights<br />
to become priviledges only for the few.

Now I return home,<br />
and sleep to contact notes,<br />
and wish I never left.
