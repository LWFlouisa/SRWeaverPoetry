From Mount Azo<br />
to Tokyo streets<br />
flowing,<br />
I always will sleep<br />
winters, with cherry<br />
trees.<br />
And this raw fish you<br />
call Sushi, with BBQ<br />
sauce.<br />
Ma Japon 

Although I am<br />
without deception<br />
for books<br />
of girls with large<br />
eyes, and twirling<br />
wands,
I cant help but drift<br />
away to new things<br />
to read.<br />
Ma Japon. 

Perhaps it is I<br />
cant relate to<br />
to the<br />
embrace of old<br />
waifus, with their sweet<br />
looks<br />
reading other books<br />
from city of "le vin et<br />
du pain".<br />
Ma Japon 

But it is that look<br />
that some adore<br />
that for<br />
me makes me drift off<br />
away to other lands<br />
of gold.<br />
Youll here about<br />
working conditions,<br />
manga<br />
creators with their desks<br />
underpayed and<br />
hungry.<br />
Ma Japon. 

And yet Winter has<br />
arrived once more<br />
for me, Ma Japon.<br />
With mount Azo growing<br />
distant, as I now go on.<br />
Ma Japon.
