From Japan to France<br />
the rocky seas pulse...<br />
the rain flows down.<br />
From Japan to France<br />
the only modern states<br />
love their manga.<br />
But for "Os Suraponica" we dance to moonlight.<br />
From Japan to France we eat feta sushi.<br />
For flavors come in many seasons after Summer.<br />

Ne swa Suraponica,<br />
Peru Sfuranka miya wifa.

Thus one has to ask,<br />
what can you give, Oji<br />
Abe, and Julian<br />
as your bridegroom<br />
from Japan to France.<br />
For "Os Suraponica" we dance to moonlight.<br />
From Japan to France we eat feta sushi.<br />
For flavors come in many seasons after Summer.<br />

Ne swa Suraponica,<br />
Peru Sfuranka miya wifa

Winter we dine<br />
with our ancestors in<br />
From Shinto in death,<br />
holding Necuronomiconas.<br />
We dance to moonlight.<br />
From Japan to France we eat feta sushi.<br />
For flavors come in many seasons after Summer
