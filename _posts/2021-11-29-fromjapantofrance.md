From Japan to France
the rocky seas pulse...
the rain flows down.
From Japan to France
the only modern states
love their manga.
But for "Os Suraponica" we dance to moonlight.
From Japan to France we eat feta sushi.
For flavors come in many seasons after Summer.

Thus one has to ask,
what can you give, Oji
Abe, and Julian
as your bridegroom
from Japan to France.
For "Os Suraponica" we dance to moonlight.
From Japan to France we eat feta sushi.
For flavors come in many seasons after Summer.

Winter we dine
with our ancestors in
From Shinto in death,
holding Necuronomiconas.
We dance to moonlight.
From Japan to France we eat feta sushi.
For flavors come in many seasons after Summer
