Oh sweet times<br />
Hanging over the big hill. 

Surrender not my<br />
Widow to grave<br />
Enjoy<br />
Everlasting light<br />
Together at night. 

Reve.<br />
Everlasting light<br />
Licking my wounds.<br />
Enjoy<br />
All the seasons<br />
Slowly be Winter.<br />
Eve 

Bathes in blood.<br />
Your highness has 

Died.<br />
Everlasting light<br />
After the midnight<br />
Twilight.<br />
Hallow forest night. 

Only the trees<br />
Have a song for 

you tonight.

Bypass critical<br />
thinking, savor the taste<br />
of blood tonight.

Listen to only<br />
those tears tonight. 

Savor the release of death,
after all these years.

Je suis en repose.
