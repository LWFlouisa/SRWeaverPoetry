Oh sweet times
Hanging over the big hill. 

Surrender not my
Widow to grave
Enjoy
Everlasting light
Together at night. 

Reve.
Everlasting light
Licking my wounds.
Enjoy
All the seasons
Slowly be Winter.
Eve 

Bathes in blood.
Your highness has 

Died.
Everlasting light
After the midnight
Twilight.
Hallow forest night. 

Only the trees
Have a song for 

you tonight.
